# CMS-in-VR

### This package is based on Unity, with Virtual Reality(VR) environment <br/>

In this package, we check following points :<br/>
* Efficiency of several locations and combinations of Camera Monitor Systems(CMS) <br/>

We measure it by the data of : <br/>
**Driver** ( velocity, pedal, steering wheel, lane change time, etc. ) <br/>
**Eye gaze** ( eye off road time, number of gazing the CMS monitor, etc. ) <br/>

* Differences in driving behavior with/without AR signal on the CMS, which let the driver know the danger of lane changing. <br/>

**AR signal** will be activated when the following car on either left or right lane is close enough to be dangerous for the driver to change the lane. <br/>

### Combination of CMS : <br/>
1 : Right beside the traditional mirror, below the A-pillar <br/>
2 : Upright and upleft side of the steering wheel <br/>
3 : A stitched display which has all rear and side views in one monitor right above the dashborad <br/>
